## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **NEVER Sell During High RSI**
❌ Selling when RSI > 70 destroyed $356,516 in the backtest  
✅ Only buy when RSI SMA(7) < 45, hold everything else

### 2. **NEVER Skip Base DCA**
❌ Skipping base buys undermines DCA foundation  
✅ ALWAYS invest $150 base on every payday

### 3. **Don't Deplete Cash Pool**
❌ Using cash for non-rainy buys breaks sustainability  
✅ Only deploy when RSI SMA(7) < 45

### 4. **Don't Change RSI SMA Threshold**
❌ Adjusting to different thresholds or using raw RSI without testing  
✅ Stick with RSI SMA(7) < 45 (backtested & optimized, reduces noise)

### 5. **Don't Overthink Market News**
❌ Skipping rainy buys because news sounds scary  
✅ Follow RSI SMA(7) rule mechanically (fear = opportunity)

### 6. **Don't Check Weekly**
❌ Daily/weekly checking creates anxiety  
✅ Only check on payday (1st & 15th)

## 📚 Summary

### Your Strategy in 3 Sentences
1. **Invest $150 every payday (1st & 15th) no matter what.**
2. **If RSI SMA(7) < 45 on payday, deploy extra $150 from cash pool.**

### Why RSI SMA(7) Instead of Raw RSI?
- **85.6% agreement** with raw RSI(14) on payday schedule

- **Minimal impact:** Only +0.4% difference in hit rate (24.25% vs 23.85%)
- **Example:** Nov 14, 2025 - Raw RSI was 38 (would trigger), but RSI SMA was 52.75 (wait signal)
3. **Save $30 every payday to replenish cash for future rainy days.**
