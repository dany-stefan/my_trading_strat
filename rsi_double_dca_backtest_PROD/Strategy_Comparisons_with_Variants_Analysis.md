### Strategy Performance Comparison (22 Years: 2003-2025)

| Strategy | CAGR | Final Value | Total Invested | Profit | vs Rainy Day Strategy |
|----------|------|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------------------|
| **🎯 YOUR RAINY DAY (Variant #2)** | **33.54%** | **$600,907** | **$104,350** | **$496,557** | **BASELINE** |
| Simple DCA (No Rainy) | 32.48% | $503,343 | $87,550 | $415,793 | **-$97,564** ⚠️ |
| Buy & Hold (Lump Sum) | 31.12% | $450,234 | $87,550 | $362,684 | **-$133,873** ⚠️ |
| Market Timing (Sell RSI>70) | 4.75% | $244,391 | $104,350 | $140,041 | **-$356,516** ❌ |

### What You Gained By Choosing This Strategy

**💰 vs Simple DCA (+$97,564 / +19.4% more wealth):**
- Same contribution schedule ($150 bi-weekly)
- Same total base contributions ($87,550)
- Only difference: Deployed the $30 savings SMARTER during RSI SMA(7) < 45
- Extra capital deployed: $16,800 during crashes → Returned $97,624 gain
- **Return on rainy capital: 581%** (every rainy $1 became $6.81)

**📈 vs Buy & Hold (+$133,873 / +26.5% more wealth):**
- DCA smoothed your entry prices over 22 years
- Rainy buys captured crash discounts (2008: -55%, 2020: -34%, etc.)
- No need to time the market with lump sum
- Built position gradually with psychological comfort

**🚫 vs Market Timing (-$356,516 / -71.8% LESS wealth):**
- Selling during RSI > 70 destroyed wealth
- Lost 28.79 percentage points vs buy-only rainy strategy
- **Lesson: NEVER sell in this strategy** — only buy more when RSI SMA(7) < 45

### Why This Strategy Works

1. **🎯 Systematic Buying During Fear** — RSI SMA(7) < 45 flags sustained oversold conditions when others panic
2. **💰 Sustainable Cash Management** — 80% hit rate means you have cash when needed
3. **📅 Payday Alignment** — Check RSI only on 1st & 15th (no weekly stress)
4. **🔄 DCA Foundation** — Always invest $150 base (never stop buying)
5. **🧠 No Emotion Required** — Simple RSI rule removes guesswork

## 🎯 Action Plan: How to Execute This Strategy

### Setup Phase (One-Time)

**Step 1: Initialize Cash Pool**
- Transfer $330 to your brokerage account (enough for 2 rainy buys)
- This is your "rainy day fund" for RSI SMA(7) < 45 opportunities
- Never touch this cash except for rainy buys

**Step 2: Set Payday Reminders**
- Calendar alerts for 1st and 15th of each month
- If weekend, reminder moves to next Monday
- Add "Check SPY RSI & Execute DCA" to reminder

**Step 3: Bookmark Tools**
- TradingView SPY chart with RSI(14) indicator
- Your brokerage buy page (pre-fill SPY ticker)
- This analysis document for reference

### Execution Phase (Every Payday: 1st & 15th)

**Step 1: Always Execute Base DCA**
- Buy $150 CAD of SPY (NO EXCEPTIONS)
- This happens regardless of RSI
- Set up auto-buy if your broker allows

**Step 2: Check RSI(14) on SPY**
- Use TradingView or your brokerage platform
- Note the current RSI value
- Use Close price (standard RSI calculation)

**Step 3: Apply Rainy Day Rule**

**If RSI SMA(7) < 45 (RAINY DAY):**
- ✅ Buy EXTRA $150 CAD of SPY from cash pool
- Total today: $300 CAD ($150 base + $150 rainy)
- Reduce cash pool: $330 → $180
- Add savings back: $180 + $30 = $210 new cash pool

**If RSI ≥ 45 (NOT RAINY):**
- ⛅ Only buy base $150 CAD of SPY
- Total today: $150 CAD (base only)
- Save to cash pool: $330 + $30 = $360

**Step 4: Update Tracking**
- Record today's RSI, price, and action
- Update cash pool balance
- Note if rainy buy was executed

### Monthly Review (Optional)

- Review cash pool balance (should be $180-$480 range)
- Count rainy buys this year (expect ~10-12 per year)
- Check equity growth vs expected 33.54% CAGR

- Sweet spot (65%-85%): Sustainable cash management

---

## Variant #1: Weekly $150 RSI < 40

### Configuration
- **Cadence:** Check RSI every Monday
- **Rainy buy:** $150 when RSI < 40
- **Base investment:** $150 bi-weekly (unchanged)
- **Cash savings:** $30 bi-weekly (unchanged)

### Performance
- **CAGR:** 33.54%
- **Final equity:** $600,967 CAD
- **Total invested:** $104,500 CAD
- **ROI:** 575% ($5.75 per dollar)
- **Hit rate:** 68.5% (113 / 165 rainy Mondays)

### Pros & Cons
✅ **Fastest deployment** during volatility (weekly checks)  
✅ **RSI < 40** catches deeper dips (more selective)  
✅ **Large positions** ($150) on real weakness  
⚠️ **Must check weekly** (every Monday)  
⚠️ **Lower hit rate** (68.5%) — misses 31.5% of opportunities  

### Why NOT Chosen
- Requires weekly monitoring (vs payday-aligned bi-weekly)
- More manual effort (52 checks/year vs 26 payday checks)
- Lower hit rate creates more "missed opportunity" anxiety

---

## Variant #2: Bi-weekly $150 RSI SMA(7) < 45 ⭐ (YOUR CHOICE)

### Configuration
- **Cadence:** Check RSI only on payday (bi-weekly Mondays)
- **Rainy buy:** $150 when RSI SMA(7) < 45
- **Base investment:** $150 bi-weekly (same day as rainy check)
- **Cash savings:** $30 bi-weekly (same day)

### Performance
- **CAGR:** 33.54%
- **Final equity:** $600,907 CAD
- **Total invested:** $104,350 CAD
- **ROI:** 576% ($5.76 per dollar)
- **Hit rate:** 80.0% (112 / 140 rainy Mondays)

### Pros & Cons
✅ **HIGHEST hit rate** (80%) — most sustainable  
✅ **Payday-aligned** — check RSI only when you get paid  
✅ **Simple schedule** — no mid-week monitoring  
✅ **Identical CAGR** to weekly variant  
✅ **Large positions** ($150) on weakness  
⚠️ **RSI SMA(7) < 45** is less selective than raw RSI < 40 (slightly earlier, smoothed entries)  
⚠️ Bi-weekly cadence might miss mid-week V-shaped recoveries  

### Why YOU Chose This
1. **Simplicity:** Only 26 checks/year (on payday), not 52
2. **Best hit rate:** 80% means less stress about depleted cash
3. **Payday sync:** Check RSI, invest base $150, save $30, deploy rainy $150 if needed — all in one session
4. **Identical returns:** Same 33.54% CAGR as weekly variant
5. **Sustainable:** 20% miss rate is healthy (not over-funded)

---

✅ **Hit rate at lower bound** (65.3% acceptable)  
⚠️ **Smaller positions** reduce upside  
⚠️ **Requires weekly monitoring**  
⚠️ **Lower hit rate** (65.3%) — near minimum threshold  

### Why NOT Chosen
- Smaller $100 positions (vs $150) with same monitoring effort
- Hit rate at minimum acceptable level (65.3%)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Selling During High RSI**
❌ **NEVER sell when RSI > 70**  
✅ **Only buy when RSI SMA(7) < 45, hold everything else**  
📊 **Evidence:** Market timing with selling reduced CAGR from 33.54% to 4.75% (-$356,516 lost)

### 2. **Skipping Base DCA**
❌ **Don't skip the $150 base buy on non-rainy days**  
✅ **ALWAYS invest base $150 (this is your DCA foundation)**  
📊 **Evidence:** DCA smoothing is core to the 33.54% CAGR

### 3. **Depleting Cash Pool**
❌ **Don't use cash pool for non-rainy buys**  
✅ **Only deploy cash pool when RSI SMA(7) < 45**  
📊 **Evidence:** 80% hit rate requires disciplined cash management

### 4. **Changing RSI Threshold**
❌ **Don't adjust to RSI < 40 or RSI < 50 without testing**  
✅ **Stick with RSI SMA(7) < 45 (backtested & optimized)**
📊 **Evidence:** RSI SMA(7) < 45 balanced hit rate (~24%) with opportunity capture and noise reduction### 5. **Overthinking Market News**
❌ **Don't skip rainy buys because news sounds scary**  
✅ **Follow RSI rule mechanically (fear = opportunity)**  
📊 **Evidence:** Biggest gains came from 2008 crisis and 2020 COVID crash

### 6. **Weekly Checking**
❌ **Don't check RSI daily/weekly (creates anxiety)**  
✅ **Only check on payday (1st & 15th)**  
📊 **Evidence:** Bi-weekly = 80% hit rate, weekly = 68.5% (over-trading)

## 📚 Appendix: Technical Details

**You chose Variant #2 (Bi-weekly $150 RSI SMA(7) < 45) because:**

✅ **Same 33.54% CAGR** as more complex weekly variants  
✅ **Highest 80% hit rate** for sustainability  
✅ **Payday-aligned simplicity** (no mid-week monitoring)  
✅ **26 checks/year** instead of 52  
✅ **Best for busy people** with regular paychecks  

**RSI SMA(7) Indicator Rationale:**

The strategy uses **RSI SMA(7) < 45** (7-day Simple Moving Average of RSI) as the rainy day threshold instead of raw RSI(14) < 45. This decision was based on comparative analysis:

- **Agreement Rate:** 85.6% alignment between RSI and RSI SMA signals on payday schedule (499 paydays analyzed over 22 years)
- **Hit Rate Impact:** Only +0.4% difference (24.25% for SMA vs 23.85% for raw RSI) — minimal change in buying frequency
- **Noise Reduction:** RSI SMA(7) filters out single-day RSI spikes that quickly reverse, preventing false buy signals
- **Smoothing Benefit:** Avoids "bear trap" scenarios where RSI briefly dips below 45 on one payday but market sentiment is still strong (e.g., Nov 14, 2025: RSI=38 but RSI SMA=52.75, indicating temporary dip rather than sustained weakness)
- **Disagreement Analysis:** Only 72 out of 499 paydays (14.43%) showed conflicting signals between RSI and RSI SMA
  - 35 paydays: RSI only signaled rainy (7.01%)
  - 37 paydays: SMA only signaled rainy (7.41%)
  - Both agreed on 427 paydays (85.57%)

**Conclusion:** RSI SMA(7) provides a more reliable signal with negligible impact on long-term returns while reducing the risk of premature deployment during short-term volatility.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
⚠️ Might miss rare mid-week V-shaped recoveries  
⚠️ RSI SMA(7) < 45 is slightly less selective than < 40  

**Bottom line:** You're not sacrificing returns for simplicity. You're optimizing for **execution consistency**, which is the real key to long-term wealth building.
