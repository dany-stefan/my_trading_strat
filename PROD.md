## 🎯 Performance vs Alternatives

### Simple DCA (No Rainy Logic)

| Metric | Value | vs Rainy Day |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Terminal Value** | $434,051 | -$85,292 |
| **Total Invested** | $59,400 | Less capital deployed |
| **Total Profit** | $374,651 (630.7%) | Lower absolute profit |
| **Investment ROI CAGR** | 9.46% | Slightly higher % |
| **Max Drawdown** | 27.55% | - |
| **Volatility (Annual)** | 20.44% | - |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 1.26 | Good |
| **SQN (System Quality)** | 6.81 | Excellent |
| **R² (Stability)** | 0.845 | - |

**🔍 Why Similar CAGR (9.26% vs 9.46%) But You Win By $85,292:**

The ROI CAGRs are nearly identical because both strategies compound efficiently. BUT:
- **You deployed MORE capital** ($73,950 vs $59,400) at OPTIMAL times (RSI < 45)
- **Every rainy $1 → $5.86** after 22 years (586% ROI on rainy capital!)
- Lower percentage return × Larger invested base = **BIGGER absolute wealth**

**The Math:**
- Simple DCA: 630.7% profit on $59,400 = $374,651
- Your Rainy: 602.3% profit on $73,950 = $445,393 ✅ **$70,742 MORE!**

**Investment Efficiency:**
- Extra deployed in rainy buys: $14,550
- Extra equity gained: $85,292
- Return ratio: **5.86x your rainy money**

**💡 Every rainy dollar becomes $5.86. That's what makes it worth it!** 🎯

### Buy & Hold ($1,000 Lump Sum)

| Metric | Value | vs Rainy Day |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Terminal Value** | $6,367 | -$440,025 |
| **Total Invested** | $1,000 | One-time investment |
| **Total Profit** | $5,367 | Lower profit |
| **CAGR** | 8.78% | - |
| **Max Drawdown** | 0.00% | - |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 14.97 | Excellent |
| **SQN (System Quality)** | 131.56 | Superb (Holy Grail) |

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ DCA approach massively outperforms lump sum
- ✅ Advantage: Smooths entry prices over 22 years
- ✅ Crash capture: Rainy buys during 2008, 2020 downturns
- ✅ Accessibility: No large lump sum needed

## 🔬 Strategy Rules & Framework

### Core Parameters

**Investment Schedule:**
- **Payday:** 1st and 15th of each month
- **Execution:** 3rd and 17th (2 days later to align with Wealthsimple recurring buys)
- **Asset:** SPY (S&P 500 ETF) converted to CAD

**Base DCA:**
- **Amount:** $150 CAD every execution day
- **Frequency:** Bi-weekly (24 times per year)
- **Rule:** Always invest, regardless of market conditions

**Cash Accumulation:**
- **Amount:** $30 CAD per execution day
- **Purpose:** Build rainy day reserve fund
- **Initial Pool:** $330 CAD (covers 2.2 rainy buys)

**Rainy Day Trigger:**
- **Condition:** RSI SMA(7) < 45.0
- **Action:** Deploy extra $150 CAD from cash pool
- **Frequency:** ~22.4% of execution days (1 in 4-5 paydays)
- **Cash Requirement:** Must have ≥$150 in pool to execute

### Why RSI SMA(7) Instead of Raw RSI(14)?

| Metric | Raw RSI(14) < 40 | RSI SMA(7) < 45 (PROD) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Signal Type** | Single-day reading | 7-day moving average |
| **Noise Level** | High (volatile) | Low (smoothed) |
| **False Positives** | Frequent (choppy markets) | Rare (confirmed weakness) |
| **Hit Rate** | 68.5% | **80.0%** ⭐ |
| **Weekly Checks** | Weekly (52/year) | Bi-weekly (24/year) |
| **Effort** | Higher | Lower (payday-aligned) |

**Benefits:**
1. **Filters Noise:** Single-day panic doesn't trigger (need sustained weakness)
2. **Confirms Trend:** 7-day weakness = real bearish move, not blip
3. **Reduces Stress:** Fewer false signals = less decision fatigue
4. **Higher Success:** 80% hit rate vs 68.5% with raw RSI

### The 4-Step Execution Process

**STEP 1: Base DCA (Always)**
```
Every execution day (3rd & 17th):
→ Invest $150 CAD into SPY
→ This happens REGARDLESS of market conditions
→ Discipline > timing
```

**STEP 2: Check Rainy Day Condition**
```
On execution day:
→ Fetch current RSI SMA(7)
→ Compare to threshold (45)
→ Determine: RAINY or NORMAL
```

**STEP 3: Deploy Extra Capital (If Rainy)**
```
IF RSI SMA(7) < 45 AND cash_pool >= $150:
→ Deploy extra $150 from cash pool
→ Total investment today = $300 CAD
ELSE:
→ Skip extra deployment
→ Total investment today = $150 CAD
```

**STEP 4: Save for Next Rainy Day (Always)**
```
After investment:
→ Add $30 to cash pool
→ Compound savings effect
→ Ready for future rainy days
```
