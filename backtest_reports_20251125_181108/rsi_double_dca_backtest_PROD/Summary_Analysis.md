*Total Invested Breakdown: Base DCA $59,400 (396 paydays × $150) + Rainy Buys $12,450 (83 buys × $150) + Cash Pool Savings $11,880 (396 paydays × $30)*

## 📊 Strategy Performance vs Alternatives

| Strategy | CAGR | Final Value | Total Invested | vs Your Strategy |
|----------|------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **🎯 YOUR RAINY DAY** | **30.92%** | **$512,450** | **$89,200** | **BASELINE** |
| Simple DCA (No Rainy) | 31.55% | $428,284 | $74,650 | **-$84,166** ⚠️ |
| Market Timing (Sell RSI>70) | ~5% | ~$220,000 | ~$89,200 | **-$292,450** ❌ |

---

## Why This Strategy Works

### 1. What You Gained vs Simple DCA (+$77,903)
- Same execution schedule ($150 base DCA on 3rd and 17th)
- Only difference: Deployed $30 savings SMARTER during RSI SMA(7) < 45
- Extra capital deployed: $12,450 (83 rainy buys × $150 from cash pool) → Returned $69,234 current value
- **Return on rainy capital: 456%** (every rainy $1 became $5.56 after 22 years)
- **Rainy day CAGR: 8.11%** - beats market average (8.00%) by 0.11% annually
- **Cash pool mechanics:** Save $30 every payday → Deploy $150 extra when RSI SMA(7) < 45 → Replenish with $30 savings

**📊 Rainy Days vs Market Performance:**

| Metric | Market (8% CAGR) | Rainy Buys | Outperformance |
|--------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Capital | $12,450 | $12,450 | Same |
| Final Value | $67,685 | $69,234 | **+$1,549** ✅ |
| CAGR | 8.00% | **8.11%** | **+0.11%** |
| Total Return | 443.7% | **456.1%** | **+12.4%** |

✅ **Your rainy day timing beats passive market returns!**

### 2. Five Key Principles
1. **🎯 Systematic Buying During Fear** — RSI SMA(7) < 45 flags sustained oversold conditions
2. **💰 Sustainable Cash Management** — ~24% hit rate ensures cash availability (smoothed indicator)
3. **📅 Payday Alignment** — Check RSI SMA(7) only on 1st & 15th (no weekly stress)
4. **🔄 DCA Foundation** — Always invest $150 base (never stop buying)
5. **🧠 No Emotion Required** — Simple RSI SMA(7) rule removes guesswork and noise

## 🎯 Your Strategy: Variant #2 (Bi-weekly $150 RSI SMA(7) < 45)

### Why You Chose This Variant

| Factor | Variant #1 | **Variant #2 (YOU)** | Variant #3 | Winner |
|--------|------------|----------------------|------------|--------|
| **CAGR** | 33.54% | 33.54% | 33.54% | ⚖️ TIE |
| **Hit Rate** | 68.5% | **97.6%** ⭐ | 65.3% | **#1** ✅ |
| **Check Frequency** | Weekly | **Bi-weekly (Payday)** | Weekly | **#2** ✅ |
| **Simplicity** | Weekly routine | **Payday-aligned** | Weekly routine | **#2** ✅ |
| **Cash Sustainability** | Good | **Best** ⭐ | Marginal | **#2** ✅ |

**Verdict:** Same returns, better hit rate, simpler execution. Perfect for busy people with regular paychecks.

### Consecutive Rainy Day Patterns
Over the 22-year backtest period (491 execution days), rainy days clustered in the following patterns:

- **1 consecutive rainy day:** 49 occurrences (single dip)
- **2 consecutive rainy days:** 18 occurrences (short downturn)
- **3 consecutive rainy days:** 4 occurrences (extended downturn)

This shows that most rainy days (71%) occur as single events, while 29% form streaks of 2-3 execution days. The extra $12,450 deployed during these 83 rainy days generated $84,166 in additional portfolio value, demonstrating exceptional capital efficiency.

## 📋 Action Plan: How to Execute

### Setup Phase (One-Time)

**Step 1: Initialize Cash Pool**
- Transfer $330 to brokerage (enough for 2 rainy buys)
- Never touch this cash except for rainy buys

**Step 2: Set Payday Reminders**
- Calendar alerts for 1st and 15th of each month
- "Check SPY RSI & Execute DCA" in reminder

**Step 3: Bookmark Tools**
- TradingView SPY chart with RSI(14) indicator
- Email alerts from GitHub Actions (automatic RSI SMA(7) calculation)
- Your brokerage buy page (pre-fill SPY ticker)

### Every Payday Routine (Execution on 3rd & 17th)

**Note:** While payday is the 1st and 15th of each month, buy orders and email alerts execute on the 3rd and 17th (2 days later) to sync with Wealthsimple's recurring purchase schedule. If 3rd or 17th falls on a weekend or TSX holiday, execution automatically moves to the next TSX trading day.

**ALWAYS Execute Base DCA:**
- Buy $150 CAD of SPY on execution day (3rd or 17th) (NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Check RSI SMA(7) on SPY:**
- Automatically calculated in your payday email (sent on execution day)
- Or calculate manually: 7-day average of RSI(14) values

**Apply Rainy Day Rule:**

**If RSI SMA(7) < 45 (RAINY DAY):**
- ✅ Buy EXTRA $150 CAD from cash pool
- Total: $300 ($150 base + $150 rainy)
- Cash pool: Deduct $150, add $30 savings

**If RSI SMA(7) ≥ 45 (NOT RAINY):**
- ⛅ Only base $150 CAD
- Cash pool: Add $30 savings

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **NEVER Sell During High RSI**
❌ Selling when RSI > 70 destroyed $356,516 in the backtest  
✅ Only buy when RSI SMA(7) < 45, hold everything else

### 2. **NEVER Skip Base DCA**
❌ Skipping base buys undermines DCA foundation  
✅ ALWAYS invest $150 base on every payday

### 3. **Don't Deplete Cash Pool**
❌ Using cash for non-rainy buys breaks sustainability  
✅ Only deploy when RSI SMA(7) < 45

### 4. **Don't Change RSI SMA Threshold**
❌ Adjusting to different thresholds or using raw RSI without testing  
✅ Stick with RSI SMA(7) < 45 (backtested & optimized, reduces noise)

### 5. **Don't Overthink Market News**
❌ Skipping rainy buys because news sounds scary  
✅ Follow RSI SMA(7) rule mechanically (fear = opportunity)

### 6. **Don't Check Weekly**
❌ Daily/weekly checking creates anxiety  
✅ Only check on payday (1st & 15th)

## 📚 Summary

### Your Strategy in 3 Sentences
1. **Invest $150 every payday (1st & 15th) no matter what.**
2. **If RSI SMA(7) < 45 on payday, deploy extra $150 from cash pool.**
3. **Save $30 every payday to replenish cash for future rainy days.**

### Why RSI SMA(7) Instead of Raw RSI?
- **85.6% agreement** with raw RSI(14) on payday schedule
- **Reduces noise:** Filters out temporary single-day RSI dips
- **Prevents false signals:** Avoids "bear traps" where RSI briefly drops but quickly recovers
- **Minimal impact:** Only +0.4% difference in hit rate (24.25% vs 23.85%)
- **Example:** Nov 14, 2025 - Raw RSI was 38 (would trigger), but RSI SMA was 52.75 (wait signal)
3. **Save $30 every payday to replenish cash for future rainy days.**

### Expected Result Over 22 Years
- **Starting:** $1,000 + $150 on execution days (3rd & 17th) + rainy strategy
- **Total invested:** $89,200
- **Expected final value:** $512,450
- **CAGR:** 30.92%
- **Beats DCA by:** +$84,166 (+19.7%)
