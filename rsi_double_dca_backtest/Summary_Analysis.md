## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **NEVER Sell During High RSI**
❌ Selling when RSI > 70 destroyed $356,516 in the backtest  
✅ Only buy when RSI < 45, hold everything else

### 2. **NEVER Skip Base DCA**
❌ Skipping base buys undermines DCA foundation  
✅ ALWAYS invest $150 base on every payday

### 3. **Don't Deplete Cash Pool**
❌ Using cash for non-rainy buys breaks sustainability  
✅ Only deploy when RSI < 45

### 4. **Don't Change RSI Threshold**
❌ Adjusting to RSI < 40 or < 50 without testing  
✅ Stick with RSI < 45 (backtested & optimized)

### 5. **Don't Overthink Market News**
❌ Skipping rainy buys because news sounds scary  
✅ Follow RSI rule mechanically (fear = opportunity)

### 6. **Don't Check Weekly**
❌ Daily/weekly checking creates anxiety  
✅ Only check on payday (1st & 15th)
